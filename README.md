## Description

FIDDLE is a free, open source “matchmaking” tool designed to help researchers to identify the publication format that will work best for a particular dataset that may be hard to publish in traditional journals (available at: http://s-quest.bihealth.org/fiddle/). Researchers can use this Shiny app to quickly compare characteristics of different publications formats and search for a format that best meets their needs. Once users have selected a publication format, they can click on links to visit websites of relevant publishers  or see a representative example of this particular format.
