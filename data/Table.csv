How to;1. Organize the data in a logical manner 2. Prepare a readme file that explains the data, abbreviations and the research context to potentially re-use and analyze the data 3. Upload data in a renowned data repository;"1. Prepare manuscript - manuscript format is informal and up to author; in general like short communication 2. Choose a fitting micropublication plattform and submit";1. Prepare manuscript in normal manner as you would submit it for journal publication 2. Choose a fitting preprint server and submit under a fitting discipline category;"1. Prepare manuscript in normal manner, except for a discussion section 2. Proceed with data similarly to ""data repository"" section";1. Prepare manuscript in normal manner 2. Choose a fitting publishing platform and submit;1. Prepare manuscript in normal manner 2. Choose a fitting null results journal and submit;1. Prepare manuscript in normal manner 2. Choose journal by checking journal websites/editorial criteria whether negative results are acceptable and submit

Advantages;"data a immediately available and archived; additions/changes are possible through versioning; data are licensed, findable, sharable, commentable, and citable";"Aimed for unpublished observations, negative/neutral results; does not require a narrative story; some offer blinded peer review, integrated open data upload, reviewer compensation; micropubs are licensed, findable, sharable, commentable, and citable; higher value than simple data deposit";"research is better described and accessible than a data deposit only; preprints are licensed, findable, sharable, commentable, and citable; preprint can be submitted to peer review later; free of charge";;;;
Disadvantages;"no scholarly publication; credit through citations, but not in publication record; data without methods and discussion might lack necessary context";flexibility in format and length might undercut the credibility of findings;;;Since plattforms are not journals - they have no Journal Impact Factor;;
Example (Best practice);"finding which confirm the hypothesis, but are not considered important enough for a publication; or in case of severe lack of time, e.g. when a person leaves short-term";"finding which confirm the hypothesis, but stand for themselves and do not fit into ""marratives""";"finding which confirm the hypothesis, but need to be published quickly; can be used if there is a reason to fear scooping; also a way to receive feedback prior to a regular paper submission";datasets for which analysis is not possible (anymore), or was not planned right from the start;"finding which confirm the hypothesis, but need to be published quickly; can be used if there is a reason to fear scooping";;mixed finding, with some being positive, and some not
